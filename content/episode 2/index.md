What is the “afro- future” of music? We’ve seen it change so drastically over the past 15 years. From records and tapes, to cds and mp3s,to limewire and napster, now we stream everything. It’s made a significant impact on how professional musicians make money, and it’s lifted the gate on who can not only MAKE music, but also get it heard, i.e. the Internet. “Music ain’t what it used to be” has never been so relevant. How is this statement relevant when we look at Black music and it’s impact over this same amount of time. Rap and Hip Hop reaches far and wide, and soul/jazz started spreading across the globe with icons like of Sarah Vaughn, Louis Armstrong, and Nina Simone, to Quincy Jones and Aretha Franklin.

<br>
As musicians ourselves, what do we see changing that we like, and what have we lost in the change?
