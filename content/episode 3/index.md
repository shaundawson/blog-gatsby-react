It’s bigger than religion.. Hip-hop. (E. Badu) But my, My, MY has it changed. We’ve seen the revolution and the evolution of Hip-Hop. On this episode I wanna get into the good changes, the bad changes. What we’re happy about happy about hearing, what makes us mad to hear. Did radio kill hip-hop and give rise to Rap? This episode is meant to be a thorough examination of the current state of Hip-Hop/Rap. From R. Kelly backlash to Drake, to Cardi vs Nicki, Cosi && Ms. Kierra Leone give us their takes.

<div class="content is-small">
<b> ComfyCosi (co’zi)</b> is one-third and the creator of the Run The Tape Podcast, New York's premiere podcast dedicated to music discovery focusing on some of the best the City has to offer. Hailing from Brooklyn, by way of Europe and the Mid-Atlantic, he's a subscriber to all things of the culture and the progression of black women in our patriarchal society and an ambassador of the "cancel" movement. Aside from that, he's the Content Director for Bask New York, an emerging creative agency focusing on merging the hipsters with the cultural influencers and those that you need to know.

<br>
<b> Kierra Leone</b> is filled with 90's nostalgia and she happens to be in charge of thinking of things before other people know they need them. In, other words, she's psychic (but not really). As she begins to exit her 20-somethings, she applies all the skills she has acquired while adulting to manifest the foundation of her custom career in music & entertainment.
